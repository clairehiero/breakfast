listed below multiple breakfast options to choose from. Breakfast
options include both vegan and non-vegan options.

This task includes instructions on how to make breakfast at my apartment
in Blacksburg, VA.

(Recipe from <https://www.acouplecooks.com/banana-baked-oatmeal/>)
*Image B: Vegan Banana Baked Oatmeal*

## Ingredients 

-   2 cups rolled oats

-   ½ cup pecan pieces (optional)

-   1 teaspoon baking powder

-   1 ½ teaspoons cinnamon

-   ½ teaspoon kosher salt

-   ¾ cup mashed banana or 2 very ripe bananas

-   1 ¾ cups milk of choice (almond, dairy or oat)

-   ¼ cup pure maple syrup

-   1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

-   For serving: Banana slices, almond butter or peanut butter

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

2.  Grease an 8 x 8" or 9 x 9" pan with coconut oil or a neutral oil.

3.  In a medium bowl, mix the rolled oats, pecan pieces, baking powder,
    cinnamon, allspice, and kosher salt.

4.  Dump the dries into the prepared pan.

5.  Mash the bananas. In the same bowl, whisk together the bananas,
    milk, maple syrup, and vanilla. Drizzle the milk mixture over the
    oats. Stir lightly with a fork to make sure everything gets evenly
    mixed.

6.  Bake 40 to 45 minutes until the top is nicely golden and the oat
    mixture has set.

7.  Remove from the oven and allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes.

8.  Before serving, spread the top with almond butter or peanut butter
    and top with fresh banana slices. See image B for reference.

#### Disclaimer 

\*Do not make the entire pan in advance and refrigerate overnight
because the oats will absorb all the liquid. It is recommended that you
mix up the wets and dries separately and store them in separate
containers (with wets refrigerated), then pour them together in the
morning and bake.
